# This file contains an ordered list of all tables.
#
# Do not modify this unless you're creating new tables to migrate or no longeer need old ones. Since Data is migrated
# in a single transaction with deferred constraint checking enabled, you should be able to just add new tables to the
# end of the list. IF you're unsure wether constraints can be deferred or not, PLEASE don't try on the live database.
#
# Each line must only contain one table and only the table because I was lazy while writing the parser. Also note that
# the table names are case sensitive.
